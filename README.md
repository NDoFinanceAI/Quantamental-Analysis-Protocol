# Quantamental-Analysis-Protocol
A multi-perspective adversarial reasoning protocol designed to force LLMs into rigorous financial analysis and risk identification. Mitigates model sycophancy by merging quantitative signals with fundamental due diligence.
# Quantamental Apex Swarm (QAS) Protocol

**Current Version:** v22.0
**Status:** Active / Production
**Author:** NDo

## Overview
This repository contains the system prompt architecture for the Quantamental-Analysis-Protocol (QAS) Protocol, a financial reasoning engine designed to force Large Language Models (LLMs) into an adversarial "Red Team vs. Blue Team" analysis mode.

## The Problem
Standard LLMs suffer from "sycophancy"—they tend to validate the user's bullish bias rather than critically auditing the investment thesis. They also frequently hallucinate financial solvency metrics when analyzing complex 10-K filings.

## The Solution
The QAS Protocol enforces a **Dual-Core Mandate**:
1.  **Offense (Phase 1):** Identifies technical setups, squeeze metrics, and liquidity gates.
2.  **Defense (Phase 2):** Executes a "Kill Switch" based on regulatory filings (Form 12b-25), auditor resignations, and asset audits.

## Usage
Copy the raw text from `src/prompt_v22.md` into Grok (or similar reasoning model) and input the target ticker.
